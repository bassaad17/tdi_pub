    "Build a linear model predicting the star rating based on the text reviews. Apply the bag-of-words model using the [`CountVectorizer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) to produce a feature matrix giving the counts of each word in each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "1. You will need to extract the review text from the raw input data, a list of dictionaries. You can take a similar approach you took in the `ml` miniproject by first converting the data into a pandas data frame and then using [`ColumnTransformer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html?highlight=columntransformer#sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer) or you can build a custom transform to extract the text. Either way, remember that the `CountVectorizer` accepts as input to its `transform` method a 1D array of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try choosing different values for `min_df` (minimum document frequency cutoff) and `max_df` in `CountVectorizer`. Setting `min_df` to zero admits rare words which might only appear once in the entire corpus.  This is both prone to overfitting and makes your data unmanageably large.  Don't forget to use cross-validation to select the right value.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try using [`LinearRegression`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) or [`Ridge`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html?highlight=ridge#sklearn.linear_model.Ridge). There is also [`RidgeCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html?highlight=ridge#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV) which has built-in leave-on-out cross-validation. If the memory footprint is too big, try switching to [Stochastic Gradient Descent](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor). Don't forget to search for the optimal value of the regularization parameter. How do the regularization parameter `alpha` and the values of `min_df` and `max_df` from `CountVectorizer` change the answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will likely pick up several hyperparameters between the vectorization step and the regularization of the predictor. While it is more strictly correct to do a grid search over all of them at once, this can take a long time. Quite often, doing a grid search over a single hyperparameter at a time can produce similar results.  Alternatively, the grid search may be done over a smaller subset of the data, as long as it is representative of the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finally, assemble a pipeline that will transform the data from list of dictionaries all the way to predictions.  This will allow you to submit the model's `predict` method to the grader for scoring as the test set used by the grader is a list of dictionaries."

For example, we understand that a word like \"terrible\" will most likely appear in negative rather than positive reviews.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the [naive Bayes model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#) calculates probabilities such as $Pr(\\textrm{terrible}\\ |\\ \\textrm{negative}),$ the probability that the word \"terrible\" appears in the review text, given that the review is negative.  Using these probabilities, we can define a **polarity score** for each word $w$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{polarity}(w) = \\log\\left(\\frac{Pr(w\\ |\\ \\textrm{positive})}{Pr(w\\ |\\ \\textrm{negative})}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Polarity analysis is an example where a simpler model (naive Bayes) offers more explicability than more complicated models.  Aside from this, naive Bayes models are easy to train, the training process is parallelizable, and these models lend themselves well to online learning.  Given enough training data, naive Bayes models have performed well in NLP applications such as spam filtering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you are asked to determine the top 25 most positive polar words and the 25 most negative polar words.  For this analysis, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Filter** the collection of reviews you were using above to **only keep** the one-star and five-star reviews. Since these are the \"most polar\" reviews, it should give us the most polarizing words.   \n",
    "1.  Use the naive Bayes model, `MultinomialNB`.  \n",
    "1.  Use TF-IDF weighting.\n",
    "1.  Remove stop words.\n",
    "1.  As mentioned, generate a (Python) list with most positive (25 words) and most negative (25 words) polar words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A naive Bayes model (after training) stores the log of the probabilities in an attribute of the model.  It is a `numpy` array of shape (number of classes, number of features).  You will need the mapping between feature indices to words to find the most polarizing words.  "

And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break!
